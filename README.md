## Dependencies  

### Using `pip` package manager  

It is highly recommended to create a Python virtual environment before installing dependencies. In a terminal, navigate to the root folder and run:  

```bash
python -m venv <venv_name>
```

Activate the environment:  

- On macOS/Linux:  

  ```bash
  source <venv_name>/bin/activate
  ```

- On Windows:  

  ```bash
  <venv_name>\Scripts\activate
  ```

Once the virtual environment is active, install the dependencies:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You're ready to go! 🚀  

### Using `uv` package manager (Highly Recommended)  

[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a modern Python package manager that is significantly faster than `pip`.  

#### Install `uv`  

To install `uv`, follow the instructions from the [official installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation).  

#### Set up the environment and install dependencies  

Run the following command in the root folder:  

```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically create a virtual environment (if none exists) and install all dependencies.  

You're ready to go! 🚀  

### Using `nix` with flakes  

If you have [Nix](https://nixos.org) installed and flakes enabled, you can set up the dependencies using the provided `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` files.  

#### Set up the environment  

Simply run the following command in the root folder:  

```bash
nix develop
```

This will automatically provide all dependencies specified in the `flake.nix` without needing a virtual environment.  

You're ready to go! 🚀
